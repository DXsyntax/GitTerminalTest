algorithms are like how you solve problems 

and algorithms are unique to one another because each person solves and thinks differently from one another

you and a whole lot of other people are already building and executing algorithms in their daily lives already 

from the way they decide to structure their morning routine 

to how they decide to spend their time in transport 

to how they decide to optimize their time in the most efficient way possible 

constraints means areas of improvement for algorithms 

because they are forced to find a solution despite the obstacles and rules they have to adhere to 

formula = 

	you start off with a naive approach 

	and then you start adding constraints each time to execute an iteration 

the first attempt will always never address all the problems and needs 

it needs to undergo repeated processes to improve and optimize
